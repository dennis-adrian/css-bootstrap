  /* WHY 62,5% ?
  This font size is great for calculations of the font size using rem
  By default, browsers give 16px of font-size to the html document
  By resizing to 62.5% it would mean that the font-size of the document is now 10px
  We can now easy calcuations by just multiplying the rem font-size by 10
  For example,
  1.6rem = 16px
  2rem = 20px
  1rem = 1px
  1.4rem = 14px
